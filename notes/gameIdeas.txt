idea

the game is played in a top down view above the player character.

should i render vision in a similar way to darkwood?

this game could be catigorized as a horror game.

the player is lost in the forest.

they are being hunted.

the goal is to find food and shelter for the night.

the time limit is sundown(9:00PM).

1 ingame hour is one real world minute.

1 ingame minute is one real world second

after sundown two wendigo spawn.

the wendigo constantly know where the player is.

the wendigo will respawn if killed.

the player will die one ingame at midnight(12:00AM) due to freezing temperatures.

the player can wait for morning(6:00AM) in a shelter

the game ends after the player dies or the player leaves the forest.

there will need to be a food system to force the player to explore.

stealth changes how the enemies load in visually.

the enemies could see the player and the player could not be the players fault.

make an inventory.

the player has to have food in their shelter or they will starve at night.
